## Features

- ðŸ”„ **Persistent Storage**: Data persists across test runs via disk storage
- ðŸš€ **High Performance**: Optimized for reads with support for up to 10,000 writes/s
- ðŸ”’ **Thread-Safe**: Secure state sharing across Virtual Users
- ðŸª¶ **Lightweight**: No external dependencies required
- ðŸ”Œ **Easy Integration**: Simple API that works seamlessly with k6

## Why Use xk6-kv?

- **State Sharing Made Simple**: Managing state across multiple VUs in k6 can be challenging. **xk6-kv** provides a straightforward solution for sharing state, making your load testing scripts cleaner and more maintainable.
- **Built for Safety**: Thread safety is crucial in load testing. **xk6-kv** is designed specifically for k6's parallel VU execution model, ensuring your shared state operations remain safe and reliable.
- **Lightweight Alternative**: While other solutions like Redis exist and are compatible with k6 for state sharing, **xk6-kv** offers a more lightweight, integrated approach:
    - No external services required
    - Simple setup and configuration

> **Note**: For extremely high-performance requirements, consider using the k6 Redis module instead.

## Installation

1. First, ensure you have [xk6](https://github.com/grafana/xk6) installed:
```bash
go install go.k6.io/xk6/cmd/xk6@latest
```

2. Build a k6 binary with the xk6-kv extension:
```bash
xk6 build --with github.com/oleiade/xk6-kv
```

3. Import the kv module in your script, at the top of your test script:
```javascript
import { openKv } from "k6/x/kv";
```

4. The built binary will be in your current directory. You can move it to your PATH or use it directly:
```bash
./k6 run script.js
```

## Quick Start

```javascript
import { openKv } from "k6/x/kv";

const kv = openKv();

export async function setup() {
    // Start with a clean state
    await kv.clear();
}

export default async function () {
        // Set a bunch of keys
    await kv.set("foo", "bar");
    await kv.set("abc", 123);
    await kv.set("easy as", [1, 2, 3]);

    const abcExists = await kv.exists("a b c")
    if (!abcExists) {
      await kv.set("a b c", { "123": "baby you and me girl"});
    }

    console.log(`current size of the KV store: ${kv.size()}`)

    const entries = await kv.list({ prefix: "a" });
    for (const entry of entries) {
        console.log(`found entry: ${JSON.stringify(entry)}`);
    }

    await kv.delete("foo");
}
```

## API Reference

### Core Functions

#### `openKv(): KV`
Opens a key-value store persisted on disk. Must be called in the init context.

#### KV Methods
- `set(key: string, value: any): Promise<any>`
  - Sets a key-value pair. Accepts any JSON-serializable value.
  
- `get(key: string): Promise<any>`
  - Retrieves a value by key. Throws if key doesn't exist.
  
- `delete(key: string): Promise<void>`
  - Removes a key-value pair.

- `exists(key: string): Promise<boolean>`
  - Checks if a given key exists.
  
- `list(options: ListOptions): Promise<Array<Entry>>`
  - Returns filtered key-value pairs.
  
- `clear(): Promise<void>`
  - Removes all entries.
  
- `size(): number`
  - Returns current store size.

### ListOptions Interface
```typescript
interface ListOptions {
    prefix?: string;  // Filter by key prefix
    limit?: number;   // Max number of results
}
```
